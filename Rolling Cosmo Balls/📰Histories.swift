                        My name is Adam. I have devoted my whole life to exploring the mysteries of the universe. Not so long ago, I managed to meet an astronaut who saw with his own eyes the entrance to a mysterious cosmic vault...

                        Unfortunately, he couldn't get inside and find out what was hidden in it. I intend to complete his mission!

                        According to one of the legends, this cosmic vault contains a collection of powerful artifacts that defy the laws of time. An ancient interstellar civilization discovered them and locked them away in a hidden space station. The vault is concealed from prying eyes by intricate labyrinths shrouded in cosmic dust and asteroid fields, but the most daunting thing that scares me...

For safety, I take some advanced tools with me, and the scientist, whose tip led me on this journey, advised me to take a jetpack. I wonder why I need it inside the space station..?
